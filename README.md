# ATM-Machine
The ATM Machine project is a simple Java-based simulation that mimics the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It provides basic banking operations such as balance checking, money withdrawal, and money deposit. The project is designed with a user-friendly console interface, and it uses object-oriented programming principles. It can serve as an excellent introduction to developing interactive applications using Java.
