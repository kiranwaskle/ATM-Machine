# ATM-Machine

🏧 Project Overview: 

The ATM Machine System is a Java-based console application designed to simulate basic functionalities of an ATM. It provides an interactive menu-driven experience for users to perform essential banking operations such as checking account balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money. The system uses simple control structures, user input, and function calls to implement these features.

This project is ideal for educational purposes, showcasing basic programming concepts in Java, including object-oriented principles like encapsulation, along with user interaction using Scanner for input.
